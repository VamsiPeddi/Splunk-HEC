I couldn't find an official and simple Python SDK for sending data to [Splunk's](http://splunk.com) HTTP Event Collector (HEC), so this is it. One simple file, two lines of code.

Feel free to fork and play around.

Install it:

    > virtualenv /tmp/hec
    > source /tmp/hec/bin/activate
    > pip install -r requirements.txt

Use it:

    # import pyHEC
    from pyHEC import PyHEC

    # use your token (read how to get it here: http://blogs.splunk.com/2015/09/22/turbo-charging-modular-inputs-with-the-hec-http-event-collector-input/)
    hec = PyHEC("PUT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE", "http://localhost")

    # this is the event you want to send
    event = {"text":"this is a message in a bottle", "whatever_else":"blabla"}

    # you can select index, host, etc
    metadata = {"index":"default", "host":"jonromero"}

    # send the event with the metadata
    print hec.send(event, metadata)

    # or without metadata
    print hec.send(event)

This is not an official Splunk release.
